### Current state

- Very much under construction.
- Will start posting thorough design writeup once design nonprofit site goes up.

### Compatible keyboards

Keyboards with at least 3x6 and having at least three thumb keys in an arc on thumb cluster. Having a number row is unnecessary, but doesn't have much opportunity cost aside from extra cost, weight, and complexity. Extra thumb keys, assuming they don't interfere with the ergonomics of the main arc of three keys, are much the same.

  - What I recommend most highly. It's essentially perfect, and checks every single box. Everything we want, nothing we don't. Bravo!
- [Bastardkb Scylla](https://bastardkb.com/product/scylla-prebuilt-preorder-2/)
  - Extra number row
  - Extra thumb keys
- [Bastardkb Dilemma Max]([https://bastardkb.com/product/dilemma-max-prebuilt-preorder/](https://bastardkb.com/product/dilemma-max-prebuilt-preorder/))
  - Flat (no concave keywells to reduce travel distance). On the one hand, this is not as ideal from a purely functional perspective. On the other hand, it makes transporting it when traveling much easier.
  - Extra number row
  - Extra rotary encoders

  - Flat (no concave keywells to reduce travel distance). On the one hand, this is not as ideal from a purely functional perspective. On the other hand, it makes transporting it when traveling much easier.
  - Extra number row
  - Extra thumb key on each side
  - Gimmicky materials and design (form over function), in my opinion, adding to expense.
 

### Semi-compaitlbe keybaords

These mostly have suboptimal thumb clusters (i.e., some configuration other than having at least three keys in an arc), but could probably work if you wanted them to.

  - Has three reasonably accessible thumb keys, just not quite ideally arranged
  - Extra number row
  - Extra thumb keys

  - Thumb keys are a bit less arc-like than ideal (in a straight line instead). But probably close enough that it would work alright since the keys are larger than 1u, if still not quite ideal.
  - Lots of extra keys
